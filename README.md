Odin Project recipes website HTML
In this project I will create a recipes website using html!
I think I know how to add a boiler plate, setup a tittle, add paragraphs, images, link and lists (unordered  and ordered!) I should also name files correctly (index.html) an put them in the correct folders (images, pages, etc.)
good luck! :D
