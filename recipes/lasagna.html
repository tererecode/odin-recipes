        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>½ pound ground beef</li>
                <li>½ (28 ounce) jar spaghetti sauce</li>
                <li>1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes</li>
                <li>½ onion, chopped</li>
                <li>Everything else</li>
            </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir beef in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain and discard grease. Add spaghetti sauce, tomatoes, onion, garlic, basil, oregano, salt, and pepper. Cook over low heat until sauce is hot, about 15 minutes.</li>
                <li>Meanwhile, fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil. Cook mafalda noodles at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain.</li>
                <li>Add cooked and drained noodles to the sauce and stir until completely coated. Sprinkle mozzarella cheese on top.</li>
