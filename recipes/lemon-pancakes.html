    <h1>Lemon-Ricotta Pancakes</h1>

        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>If these pancakes were any lighter, they would float off the plate--and I didn't even separate the eggs and whip the whites. Also, I used water instead of milk--and I liked them better that way. I like to serve these with a pat of butter, a pinch of lemon zest, and a drizzle of maple syrup.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>¾ cup cold water or milk</li>
                <li>½ teaspoon baking soda</li>
                <li>½ cup ricotta cheese</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon grated lemon zest (just the yellow part of the skin)</li>
                <li>Everything else</li>
            </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Whisk water and baking soda together in a mixing bowl. Add ricotta cheese, lemon zest, vegetables oil, sugar, egg, and vanilla. Whisk until smooth, breaking up lumps of cheese as you mix. Add melted butter, lemon juice, and 1 cup plus 2 tablespoons self-rising flour. Whisk together, stirring until most of flour disappears into the batter.</li>
                <li>Let batter sit at room temperature about 15 minutes</li>
                <li>Heat lightly greased cast iron skillet or griddle over medium-high heat. Portion out 1/4 cup scoops of batter onto skillet (cook in batches). When bubbles begin to form on the surface and the edges of the pancakes start to look dry (2 to 3 minutes), flip and cook other side until cooked through, 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer to a warm plate.</li>
